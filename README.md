# NoA Ignite - code exercise

## Short description:
This is a coding exercise for applying for internship at NoA Ignite! 

The instructions were: 
- Build a react app showing two buttons and a counter (as shown in received mock-ups), with functionality connected to the buttons. 
- The buttons should have a certain styling as detailed in the instructions I received, and should increase/decrease the count displayed in the counter. 
- The counter is connected to an array of git-repos, and upon increasing/decreasing the count the number in the counter should correlate with the position in the array of repos - showing some data about that repository. 
- The app should include error handling for the API, and other possible errors. 
- For an extra feature - the app could display a loader while new data is being fetched from the API.
